Joker Poker

... is a distributed online [estimation poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) application crafted with ‚ù§Ô∏è.

**How it works**

There are two important screens ...

1) The ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/master/assets/People/SVG/ic_fluent_people_20_filled.svg) _Team Estimate_ screen shows all team mates and their estimates, including yourself
1) The ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/master/assets/Person/SVG/ic_fluent_person_20_filled.svg) _My Estimate_ screen shows your estimate and allows you to change it

and two important events ...

1) The _team starts estimating_ - all estimates are reset and hidden and all team mates are taken to the _My Estimate_ screen
1) _All team mates have estimated_ - all estimates are revealed and all team mates are taken to the _Team Estimate_ screen, you can still change your estimate
 
You can change between screens any time by clicking on your own estimate or via the menu.
If any teammate presses _Reset_ the _team starts estimating_.

To make sure JokerPoker correctly detects that _all team mates have estimated_ set yourself as _observer_ when you are not estimating. You can do so from the ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/master/assets/Person%20Settings/SVG/ic_fluent_person_settings_20_filled.svg) _My Settings_ screen

If needed a teammate can be made an _observer_ be anybody under ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/master/assets/People%20Settings/SVG/ic_fluent_people_settings_20_filled.svg) _Team Settings_.

   * all data is only stored locally in each participants browser
   * The [Yjs websocket connector](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket) is only used for communication between participants (NAT traversal)
   * We maintain [an instance on glitch ](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/private-mango-chili) that uses an [unmodified fork of the Yjs socket connector](https://github.com/culmat/y-websocket). If you don't trust us, host your own service.

**Questions & Answers**

 * _How can we know what we estimate? Why can't I set a description / sync with my issue tracker <XYZ>?_ 
 * JokerPoker is meant to be used on a secondary ( mobile ) screen. We assume you use other communication channels like voice and screen sharing in parallel. Your physical estimation poker cards don't show the topic either. [üòó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

**History**

This is a complete rewrite of the [original JokerPoker](https://github.com/culmat/joker-poker).

While the user interface has changed from Vue2/Vuetify to Vue3/NaiveUI the main reason was the move from TogetherJS to YJs as communication layer that should scale much better and fix the [open issues in legacy JokerPoker](https://github.com/culmat/joker-poker/issues).

The main repository and issue tracker is now  [@ Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/culmat/joker-poker/).
